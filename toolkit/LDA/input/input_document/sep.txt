#Sep File Format:
#(component type)[component position](component separaters)[x][start position of valid separated strings]
#Four component types: l w d, representing line, words and documents  
#For type l, [component position],[x] and [start position of valid separated strings] must be omitted; for others, they must be mentioned.
#For type l, only one kind of "string separater" is permitted and declared in (component separaters); for others,  multi "character separaters" are permitted and declared in (component #separaters).  
#
#For example, the first line of our input document is :
#id=3258829//title=Network and supply chain system integration for mass customization and sustainable behavior.//year=2012//#conference=Advanced Engineering Informatics//citation=-1//authors=57741|#A. J. C. Trappey,Amy J. C. Trappey,Amy Trappey%19285|P. M. Wognum
#
#Since the string separater of the whole line is "//", we wrote l//  
#
#Then because the word component is the 2nd components of this line, we wrote 1 after w
#Because the character separaters for words component are '=', ' ' and '.', so we wrote = . after w1
#Finally, because the valid separated strings start from the 2nd word "Network", we wrote 1 after w1= .x
l//
w1= .x1
d1=x1

#l#
#w1= `~!@#$%^&*()-_=+{}[]|\:;"'?/<>,.0123456789x0
#d0#x0

#The three types must be mentioned in a separater file but the order is arbitrary
